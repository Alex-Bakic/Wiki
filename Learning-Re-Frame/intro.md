## The Re-Frame Framework 

Re-Frame is a library that is built upon [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent), which is an interface for
Clojurescript to React.js. I'm going to change the way I do this section of the "Learning-**" series, by making a project 
on the side that I will be attempting to build as I go along. The aim will be to structure the knowledge both you and I 
will get from this into a small project. The project in mind is simple but constructive, it is an app that will allow us 
to keep some ideas that pop into our head, like a basic [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/). But I'm going to steer it towards 
comedy, and the ideas being comedy sketches. After I get the basics down I would love to add the ability for the user to 
upload files to the site of which are the scripts for the idea.

-- to do, 

define what is re-frame
the overall concepts of re-frame
the parts which comprise a re-frame application
a look at the very basic todomvc example with walkthrough
using those parts start build own project showing adaptation
