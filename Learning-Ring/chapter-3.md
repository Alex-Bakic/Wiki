## Learning Ring Chapter 3

In this chapter we are going to be looking at what makes a good ring application vs what makes a great application. I'm also going to introduce [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) in this chapter, which is a Clojure to HTML DSL.I'll briefly introduce it before looking at some of the best practices to improve the readability, usability, and security of Hiccup Code. There is also a lot to cover on the Ring side, which proper session management and security best practices all of which we will get round to!
